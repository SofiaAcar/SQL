-- CUSTOMER RETENTION ANALYSIS


-- 1. Create a view that keeps visit logs of customers on a monthly basis. (For each log, three field is kept: Cust_id, Year, Month)

            FROM combined_table; 

SELECT * 
FROM customer_logs 
ORDER BY Cust_id;

-- 2. Createa view that keeps the number of monthly visits byusers.(Separately for all months from the business beginning)

CREATE VIEW monthly_visits_num AS

-- 3. For each visit of customers, create the next month of the visit as a separate column.

CREATE VIEW Next_Visit AS

-- 4. Calculate the monthly time gap between two consecutive visits by each customer.

CREATE VIEW Time_Gap AS
SELECT *, (Next_Visit_Month - Current_Month) Time_Gaps
FROM Next_Visit


SELECT *
FROM Time_Gap


--///////////////////////////////////////////////////


-- 5. Categorise customers using average time gaps.Choose the most fitted labeling model for you.
-- For example:
-- Labeled as churn if the customer hasn't made another purchase in the months since they made their first purchase.
-- Labeled as regular if the customer has made a purchase every month. Etc.

SELECT Cust_id, Avg_Time_Gap, 
       CASE WHEN Avg_Time_Gap IS NULL THEN 'Churn'
            WHEN Avg_Time_Gap = 1 THEN 'Regular' 
            WHEN Avg_Time_Gap > 1 THEN 'Irregular' END Cust_Labels

      (SELECT Cust_id, AVG(Time_Gaps) Avg_Time_Gap
      FROM Time_Gap
      GROUP BY Cust_id) A

/* Month-Wise Retention Rate
Find month-by-month customer retention ratei since the start of the business.
There are many different variations in the calculation of Retention Rate. 
But we will try to calculate the month-wise retention rate in this project.
So, we will be interested in how many of the customers in the previous month could be retained in the next month.
Proceed step by step by creating views. 
You can use the view you got at the end of the Customer Segmentation section as a source. */

-- 1. Find the number of customers retained month-wise. (You can use time gaps)


SELECT *, COUNT(Cust_id) OVER (PARTITION BY Next_Visit_Month) Retentition_Month_Wise
FROM Time_Gap
WHERE Time_Gaps = 1
ORDER BY Cust_id, Next_Visit_Month

-- 2. Calculate the month-wise retention rate.
--    Month-Wise Retention Rate = 1.0 * Total Number of Customers in The Previous Month / Number of Customers Retained in The Next Month
